## 📌 Overview
This project implements and compares multiple recommendation algorithms using *The Movies Dataset (Kaggle)*.  
The goal is to evaluate several models under a consistent setup and identify which approach provides the most accurate and scalable recommendations.

The following models were implemented:

1. *Content-Based Filtering*
   - TF–IDF Vectorizer  
   - CountVectorizer  
   - Cosine Similarity  

2. *Collaborative Filtering*
   - User–User CF  
   - Item–Item CF  

3. *Popularity-Based Recommendation*

4. *Hybrid Recommendation Model*
   - Weighted Rating (IMDb formula)  
   - Blended Popularity Score  

5. *Latent Factor Model (SVD)*
   - Using Surprise Library  

Each part of the system is modularized into separate Python scripts as required.
